# BSc-Programming-Assignments
This is an archive for basic BSc level programming assignments completed at University of Helsinki during years 2019 - 2022.
Most of the exercises consist of creating an algorithm to solve some task efficiently.
The algorithms are purely my own work, however the tests, file names and task descriptions are mainly based on the assignments given on courses.
